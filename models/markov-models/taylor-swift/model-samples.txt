someday when you were still gone, gone and gone

Taylor Lyrics:
And there's a drawer of my things at your window

I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one

Taylor Lyrics:
From going out with you, all the time
i've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
i check it once, then i check it twice, oh!

Taylor Lyrics:

Don't know who i'm going to talk to now at school
but i know i'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers

Taylor Lyrics:
So i drive home alone, as i turn off the light
i'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

Taylor Lyrics:
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night

Taylor Lyrics:
And you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Taylor Lyrics:
Oh i'm just a girl, trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me do
look what you made me play

Taylor Lyrics:
And the first thing that you like
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
cause we never gave in

Taylor Lyrics:
I'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl
oh i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Taylor Lyrics:
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down
and the story of us might be ending soon

Taylor Lyrics:
That's fine, i'll tell mine that you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now

Taylor Lyrics:
And when you take, you take the very best of me
so i start a fight cause i need to feel something
and you just see right through me
